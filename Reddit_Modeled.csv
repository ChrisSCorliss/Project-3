"  Hey    .  , So apart from what you see in the title, I am a 22 year old Canadian student attending undergraduate business school pleting a merce degrees with the aforementioned major and minor Data intelligence is not available as a major here so minor is all I got to work with . Now apart from maybe specializing in a more quantitative finance based courses or business analytics based courses, what can I do to put me on the right path to work as a data analyst and maybe scientist? Now No, I do **not** want to switch out of finance as I am able to maintain a good GPA above a 3.7 here and if I switch to something not only will it make my time in university longer which I cannot afford both literally and figuratively, I don't want to switch to something too abstract that may hurt my grades due to a lack of aptitudes plus I have seen many on this Reddit e from a finance background. If it's needed economics or business technology management basically a more advanced MIS program is the only place I'll budge towards. So: What is a good first programming language to learn for Data? Python I'd assume with SQL? What are some good projects I could do to help cater my expertise to a more analytica data-based side? Coursera or Udemy for learning Data Scienc Analyst material? Is Tablea Microsoft Database necessary? Thanks, sorry for the length. **TLDR : Undergrad Finance Student with minor in data looking for things he could d learn to get in to data scienc analytics field which languages to learn, topics to learn, projects I can do for Resume, books etc .**",1

Any advice is appreciated as I don't want to waste his time or mine - To add more information - I am just in the very beginning of learning data science and have very little knowledge or understanding surrounding the scope or specifics of it. I have experience in R and a little in Java and python, I watch tidy tuesday's and am going to be attending school for a data science certificate in May.

"&gt; However one thing I did notice is that for example I did not really know what a pivot is while trying to understand quicksort, and I still don't. The pivot is the point at which you cut the list into left and right parts. There's literally nothing more to it. Where it gets hairy is when you're looking at how the choice of pivot affects runtime performance... quicksort is notoriously nasty to analyse with notoriously fickle properties. Merge sort is much cleaner. Generally, with algorithms, it helps tremendously to actually implement them.",0
"&gt; I have no idea what a reverse proxy is. There's little use for puter science in system administration, which is apparently what your job entails.

You might have learned the basics - enough to do your data structures algorithms homework - but there's a lot more to learn, once you focus on designing implementing debugging maintaining software.",0

"&gt; Just to clarify, does {a, b}* refer to all possible binations including epsilon of a and b? Yes. Well we actually use Σ here, it's just that Σ = {a,b} ;  &gt; .. hence some states could fail? Some states accept which shouldn't if that's what you mean, yes. &gt; Wouldn't that be solved by setting such states to transition to themselves by all possible inputs? No, they would still accept. --- Take the example automata from my first ment ie. L = {aa} where the state q₃ is redundant. Setting F = Q would give you:    q₀ -a-&gt; q₁ -a-&gt; q₂    \    b-&gt; q₃  So the accepted language - say L' - is now {ε,a,aa,b}. However, the Pref L = {ε,a,aa}, so q₃ should not accept such that b is not in L'. The reason for this is because q₃ does not lead to an accepting state ever. If we instead had this L = {aa,bba} :    q₀ -a-&gt; q₁ -a-&gt; q₂    \     ^    \    b     b-&gt; q₃ -' Then we would be fine with setting F = Q because the prefix language is {ε,a,aa,b,bb,bba} there is a path from q₃ to a final state now, so we include it basically .",0

"&gt; The key concept here is acyclic. If you have a DAG then you are guaranteed there are no cycles no loop-arounds in it. &gt; It has to fork out like a tree. This is not correct.

"&gt;I draw out algorithms on paper to understand them That's good, I'd say take the time to deep dive into every algorithm like that until you *really* understand it. Your brain needs to really engage with a subject before it can properly remember and understand it. If I just read the material I might be able to do the easier exercises, but not anything plicated under exam conditions. If you can do exercises, great. If you can't, go back to the theory and spend time playing around with every part of it. If you don't understand the theory, go back to the part where they build up the foundations for it, etc. I personally never read more than a page or two of any math I'm trying to study without also playing around with it a bit. I'll constantly be writing a few lines of summary of what I'm reading so my brain is actively engaged with the subject, and then for every theorem I'll try to work though the derivation step by step using the textbook as a reference where it isn't obvious and work through some examples.",0
"&gt;Is it possible that he problem was formulated differently? No, the problem is literally the following: ""Show that if a language L ⊆ {a, b}∗ is recognised by some finite automaton, then so are the following languages, consisting of all the prefixes and suffixes of the words in L:  i. Pref L = {x ∈ {a, b}∗ | xy ∈ L for some y ∈ {a, b}∗}. """,0
"&gt;Just to make sure: You do know what ""prefix"" means? Our material hasn't touched any theory behind prefixs and postfixs, but from the definition given in the assingment I deduce that the prefix set Pref L is the set of strings such that they lead to a state where an accepted state can be reached with another possibly empty string.",0

&gt;That theorem applies only to the paramete return mappings of a function Why would you say that?  The very first sentence in that article is: &gt; Gödel's i pleteness theorems are two theorems of mathematical logic that demonstrate the inherent limitations of every formal axiomatic system capable of modelling basic arithmetic.,0
"&gt;The key-insight in this exercise is: Every x ∈ Pref L ""lies on the path"" from q₀ to some final state, so we mark all the potential states in-between as final. I'm denoting the transformation function as d q,x , where q is some state q and x is the input string. So to wrap things up, we set  F' = {q | x ∈ Pref L , d q\_0, x leads to q s.t. y ∈ {a, b}\*, d q, y leads to d q\_f, e where q\_f ∈ F} And we are done?   I'm supposing if this is to be done to postfixes as well, then F' = {q | x ∈ Post L , y ∈ {a, b}\* s.t. d q\_0, y leads to q s.t. d q, x leads to d q\_f, e where q\_f ∈ F} &amp;#x200B; My usage of set notations can be hard to read and even wrong I appreciate any feedback on it.

"&gt;To create test data, I would follow  snowbirdnerd  . snowbirdner 's advice of generating data randomly. Treat each feature as an independent variable and create new records by randomly sampling a value from the observed values in each column. This should create new binations of values not seen in the original data. This is a very strong assumption. In the test data, then you could have someone who's 2 years old that's 5'10 and weighs 500 lbs. This doesn't tell us how well the model is performing.  Rather, I would start with a simply linear model and determine something as an outlier if it falls outside of the prediction interval. This can help you generate labels.",1
"&gt;Williamson proposes a number of ways these organizations might find the funds to support universal open access. One would be to increase conference fees. Another is to cut munity initiatives that are not economically self-sustaining, such as student travel grants, regional development activities, and educational events. Williamson says an ideal solution would be attracting additional philanthropic donations to support open access. I think this cuts to the heart of the matter: ACM and IEEE do more than just provide paper distribution services. Whether that's a good thing or not is a matter of discussion, but you have to recognize where those organizations stand before paring them to ArXiv. Perhaps a more fair parison would be to swap out ArXiv for USENIX, which organizes all sorts of conferences and provides proper publication venues with all sorts of experts volunteering to be reviewers for them. All papers in USENIX conferences are open access.",0

Autoencoder's probably will be a good start. Generative models can be used as one-class classifiers.,1
"Autoencoders all the way. I did my bachelor's thesis specifically on anomaly detection in web traffic using restricted Boltzmann machines and pretty much the entirety of the thesis period I kept getting drawn to autoencoders and deep autoencoders, but my thesis supervisor specifically kept me from abandoning the RBM. Towards the end I started messing with autoencoders to pare results and they were far superior. Generative modelling is definitely one of the best ways to do this. Discriminative classification methods such as regression or SVM can be used once your model is trained, but first you need to teach the model what normal data looks like.",1

Additionally, the field is saturated with people who relish in feelin sounding smart. In my experience the fact that you can identify how much you don't know is a sign of self awareness and implies a desire to improve. Both really desirable traits in a new hire in my mind. Practice writing your own code now and then to learn why certain strategies in coding are used. Learn to read code because college only ever teaches you to write. And if it isn't clear yet, learn about our lord and Savior the debugger. Seriously though anyone who just spews jargon at you, claims to be a master in 10 languages etc. Are usually just full of shit. A really key lesson to get over the imposter feeling was to realize that at all times everyone around you is covering their imposter insecurities by talking a big game.",0

CLAFIC method might also be suitable. You don't need anomaly data to train it. Pattern matching using Dynamic Programming could also be considered.,1
Came here to say this. Auto encoders sounds like the way to go. The basic idea is that when the reconstruction accuracy drops dramatically it indicates the algorithms inability to encode and reconstruct what it just saw and so it probably isn't representative of the data it was trained on. Can train an autoencoder and then throw in some artificial data that's 'anomalous' and see how it does.,1

But a small startup with a lot of cash, and a strong need for a very in-demand skillset could certainly push a CEO to open up the talent pool. The other concern from employers is that you may not get sponsorship, but DS employers are starting to get less concerned about that because you can realistically get 2-3 years out of someone that *doesnt* get sponsored, which in this day and age is about as long as you can expect an employee to stay with you.",1

"From what I've seen in Silicon Valley, ""data scientist"" has no fixed meaning; it's a fluid term that bines some or all of the following roles:  \- Analyst  \- Machine learning researcher  \- Machine learning engineer  \- Data engineer i.e., building and maintaining data pipelines and storage  \- Productio devops engineer  \- Project manager for data-focused projects The smaller the team, and the smaller the pany, the more likely a ""data scientist"" will be expected to wear all those hats. \*Especially\* if the pany is small or new enough that it doesn't realize it needs all those roles before hiring a data scientist. However, there's plenty of fuzzy expectations even at larger panies about what exactly a ""data scientist"" should be expected to do and what level of mastery they should have in each skill area. Obviously, that's too much work for any one person in most cases. My advice to the OP is to keep their eyes open to figure out which bination of those roles their specific job seems to require.

"General advice: as a junior out of college you're not expected to already know these technologies and tear through projects at first. Your manager is likely trying to give you tasks that will trigger this kind of new learning. When you're hired as a junior, the pany is investing in you - they want you to learn and b e productive over the long term. Take your time to research the problems you're given until you understand. In your example, you can continue to research what a reverse proxy is and why it's useful. Once you have a decent understanding of the problem, see if you can find examples of ingress controllers within your pany. Your pany's codebases and your colleagues are great resources for b ing a great developer. Try to get as far as you can and narrow down what you don't understand into specific questions as opposed to general concepts. Once you get there, don't hesitate to ask for hel advice. As long as you build the habit of learning as much as you can from new projects and strike the right balance between learning vs shipping quickly and researching vs asking for help, you'll get a deep understanding of this stuff in no time. If you ask for help and someone gives you a solution you don't understand, follow up until you do. Imposter syndrome is very mon, but in most cases it's all about how you interpret the situation. If your colleagues know a lot that you don't, then you're in the right place! It means you have a ton of people to learn from, and you'll know these things soon as long as you build good habits.",0

I have used STATA in my studies. I am learning R right now through Edx Harvard program. I’m just not sure where to go from here and I feel defeated. I can’t even get a job as a regular data analyst.

Hey in 1978 I was 7 years old. My dad brought home a Wang 2200T which was a pull from a customer site. It has an introduction to Wang BASIC  link  .wang2200.or doc languag ProgrammingInBasic.700-3231E.9-76.pdf  manual and I turned the machine on and started going through the guide. I was hooked. I was still writing Wang BASIC into the early 90s although most of my work by then was in C.,0

I need advice to select 3 preferred out of the following biostatistics topics for the master thesis, 1 most preferred, 3 least preferred, and i would like to know which are the most beneficial for a future career in data science, in order of preference, taking into consideration that I would like to get a job in some Industry and not a research job, so the topic or the tools used could be of a practical use rather than research. 1       Multiple imputation methods for handling missing data 2       Propensity score methods for performing treatment parisons in observational data 3       Developing prediction models and treatment parisons in electronic health records 4       Big data methods integrating multi-omics platforms 5       Survival analyses incorporating peting risks 6       Methods for analyzing microbiome data 7       Spatio-temporal models for mapping disease rates and disease clusters 8       Causal inference methods 9       Meta-analysis and network meta-regression 10      Advanced longitudinal data models 11      Graphical models in medicine 12      Hierarchical model applications in public health",1
"Hi, so Im a double major in Comp Sci basically taking the 2x courses required for major . Ive been thinking if I can get into Data Sci? I kinda suck at stats, but stats at our school is known for ""weeding"" out people and the instructors have even said that the course is meant to fail out many people. So, Im not sure if I would need a stats major or minor to get into data sci? Or can I just get into data sci with solely a Comp Sci degree? Im interested in keeping my path to data sci open as Im not sure if my heart lies in CS only , but my school is known for having a shit stats dept. Would appreciate any advice.",1
"Hmm, yeah, based on OP's ment about Reddit not letting him post a ment, I'm convinced it's an issue on Reddit's end. For more detail, the only way around this problem is to give datascience-bot some memory of it's past behavior. Today, that means he ignores removed submissions. I could stand up a DynamoDB backend to track him, or I could just use Reddit's systems as the database. I opted for the latter when creating him.  Since Reddit was down, datascience-bot's ""database"" was down, and so he had no short-term memory.  The refactor will give datascience-bot more prehensive memory, but I doubt I'll stand up a DynamoDB backend for this specific use case. Doing so just moves the problem into my wallet and into services I have to monitor and manage. Today Reddit does it for free and has a dedicated ops team to fix these issues. Thanks for flagging the issue!",1
"Honestly it's pretty domain specific. These are all pretty specialized so there's relatively few if any here that you can say that most data scientists know.

But hey, your doing a project for an undergraduate degree. Nobody is expecting you to do everything you initially proposed or even actually achieve everything. Your examiners are most likely looking for how you learn, your methodologies, your research approach, your planning etc. They understand the plexity and will mark you accordingly.  Your project is what people do at PhD and would spend years researching. And again examiners would know this.  Personally I find it useful to make contact with researchers in my university, who have experience in the field. Also does your university require a software artefact to be produced, or can it be primarily research based.",0

"I can answer these: 1. No test scores are required, except possibly TOEFL for non-native English speakers. You can submit test scores if you think it would help your application, but they’re not important. 2. It’s a mix. You’ll definitely have to use Python, R, and probably MATLAB at some point in the program. Most of the advanced courses let you implement the code in whatever language you choose, but they might only give you starter code in one language. 3. Depends on the course. It’s similar to Coursera, but most course have TAs doing the grading. A few classes have multiple choice homework and quizzes, but most are more open ended. Some courses require writing math proofs. A few courses have proctored exams, and the software they use is fairly annoying. Other courses have take home, open-book exams.",1

"I decided to do probabilistic modelling meaning I’ve spent the last few months learning markov chains and temporal logics and also protocols similar to the one I have chosen and the steps and maths behind it. However, it all just seems like it’s going nowhere. It’s something not many people have done so I have limited resources to read on. It’s also very technical has more writing and calculating rather than coding.  Even the coding, is in a language that I’ve been trying to learn called PRISM. Moreover, it’s verification. How do I know what I’m modelling is correct or accurate, that now is another problem. I’m constantly filled with doubt because there’s no way to check if what I’m doing is actually making sense. What if I make a small numerical or logical flaw that discredits my whole verification. What then? These are the reasons I want to change my project. I feel it is better to work with languages I know and some I don’t know to make a functional project.

"I don't know what PagerDuty is, but I conduct interviews all the time. For interns, I don't expect them to have an impressive resume - the whole point to internships is getting experience so expecting experience is stupid. Also I don't expect them to have all the answers. When I'm talking to them I ask if they something covered in class already and if not I'm just off to the next question. If you haven't had the class and can still talk intelligently about the subject, that's bonus points. I do expect people to be excited to learn, and understand fairly well the things they claim to understand. As for tips, be honest. Claiming to know an answer and then guessing wrong gives a way worse impression than saying ""I don't know"". Having something on your resume that's not impressive is better than being found out on a trumped-up bullet point. Show you've been paying attention in class: If you're talking about something already covered, you should be able to show you've internalized it by giving examples of where you might use it. Demonstrate some awareness of soft skills: munication, teamwork, conflict resolution, some understanding of the why's of software development processes. Internships shouldn't be petitions after all, if you're already amazing then why do you need help from an internship? , but when there's lots of applicants for few spots, rankings are inevitable. If you don't e out on top, don't take it personally. Cast a wide net, take the opportunities presented to you to make yourself awesome, and you'll be alright.",0

"I felt the same exact way when I graduated. Start small, constantly learn, and let the snowball effect take over. Here’s my story;  I graduated about 2 years ago and got into a smaller start up pany ~40 people 10 devs . The rest of my coworkers were older than me and had been in the industry for a bit longer. I quickly realized that my breadth of knowledge in the industry was severely lacking.  I found that my years of studying CS topics like: algorithms, operating systems, puter systems, networks, data structures, discrete mathematics, etc really only taught me things at a conceptual level. And honestly looking back at it my CS program was seriously dated. It’s hard to learn new technology from professors that haven’t been in the industry for a few years. So yeah I quickly felt like I didn’t gain anything or much at all from my degree.  Fortunately, my pany couldn’t have been more supportive and my imposters syndrome forced me to go into fight or flight mode and try to learn as much as I possibly could.  I started in PHP - a very small part of our code base- and was basically writing scripts that performed ETL extract, transform, load tasks. Once I gained some confidence, my pany tasked me to learn Unity.  I wrote C# scripts to basically run my unity applications. C# is an amazing language to improve your programming skills because it’s strongly typed and you can implement OOP concepts easily. My pany assigned me to build an AR app for a Fortune 500 pany. That was a wild experience but turned out to be a success. This has been my most proud a plished yet  I then jumped over into our main application and have been learning web development ever since. I’ve taken on more of a backend role. I currently design and develop our APIs. I leverage cloud services AWS and architect and develop serverless applications.  In short, don’t get caught up with not learning anything in school. You did learn how to learn which is the most important thing. Just start doing.  Best of luck to you!!",0
"I graduated 11 years ago and I still feel like I don't know anything some days. I have always found that having a general, high-level understanding of how things work is more important than being a guru. Technology changes so fast and there is so much of it that you will never know everything, but as long as you can research a topic and pick out what you need you'll do fine.",0
"I guess that might be true. But for instance I was heavily discouraged from taking CS classes, and those would have benefited me greatly. I actually regret not taking them.",1
"I guess that's why learning tough material pays, because not a lot of people are willing to go through the suffering so hence not as many people can do a particular thing as the ones who did go through the suffering.  And some people don't even attempt to go through the suffering because they try it once, get their finger burned and then back off immediately and decide something just isn't for them.",0
"I had Sedgewick's ""Algorithms"" as my textbook when I took ""Introduction to Algorithms"" as an undergrad at Pitt. I won't argue, it's a difficult read that basically states theorems but ""leaves it to the reader"" to prove. It requires a firm grasp of logical deduction &amp; induction to understand, and is more involved with abstract theory than practical application. Fun fact: if you get the ""Algorithms in C++"" book, none of the code examples can pile even when supplied with supporting code around the snipits! Do not feel dumb or less of yourself -- it requires a theoretical mindset to approach successfully. One thing that helped me greatly was I had taken another class at the same time and was r mended buying the CRC ""Mathematics Tables &amp; Formulae"" manual  smile.amazon Standard-Mathematical-Formulas-Advances-Mathematic d 149877780 ref=sr\_1\_1?keywords=CRC+mathematics+tables&amp;qid=1580156974&amp;sr=8-1  smile.amazon Standard-Mathematical-Formulas-Advances-Mathematic d 149877780 ref=sr_1_1?keywords=CRC+mathematics+tables&amp;qid=1580156974&amp;sr=8-1 . Oddly enough, *everything* I didn't understand in the textbook or through lecture was covered in that book in concise and applicable detail! My advisor actually r mended that I talk to the dean about including it with the textbook list for the course! Fair warning, it is not going to teach you how to reason about the problems -- it'll only help you to understand the underlying theory. In terms of solving some of the problems like 4.2.29 , you're going to have to put some effort into it by playing with potential solutions on paper and moving it to code. Some of these require a top-down approach to the problem, whereas others need a bottom-up or a meet-in-the-middle approach. After a while, you'll gain an intuition about which tactic helps.",0

"I haven’t read Sedgwick—maybe I should—but I have read parts of Knuth and all of Skiena. So if I may make a few observations: 1. Yes, “graph theory” is a subdiscipline of mathematics. The mathematics of puter science cuts across several subdisciplines of what’s generally known as “discrete mathematics.” 2. Not having read Sedgewick, I don’t know how much material on how to do proofs of algorithm and data structure properties it contains. But I’ll make the general observation that how to express propositions you want to prove, the logic you use to construct the proof, techniques of proof construction, etc. take entire books by themselves. 3. It is _absolutely_ normal to feel pletely at sea when confronting formal mathematics of any kind, even with some sort of explanation right in front of you. Mastering puter science is akin to mastering concert-level piano performance, or receiving a black belt in a martial art, or b ing a professional heart surgeon. That is, it’s nearly impossible.

"I know Amazon has APIs just for this purpose, so other sites might as well.  You do have to read the terms of service to make sure your use case is allowed. I think if you are just generating referrals and doing price parison it might be okay. But it's also possible they don't allow price parisons. One trick that can work is to use a custom search engine from Google and use their API to search for product listing pages. Often the search results will have pricing attached to the metadata. Look into the microformats pages use to tell search engines about product SKU and price, if that is available it will make your job much easier.

I mention this because several of them are concerned with concepts closely related to software development, but they are also just generally delightful. There are also plenty of technical books that are well-written and not ""textbook""-y, but which may be more concerned with ""software development as a field"" than puter science"".

"I'd argue that each software has their perks. Tableau is 'pretty' and can be installed on Mac or Windows, while PowerBI has a great user munity that's constantly creating new visualizations to use. I like the map features available in Power BI, and prefer the learning curve for less adept organizations that are used to the Microsoft naming conventions. For example, queries and pivots are very relatable to the same process in Excel, which a larger audience can grasp. However, PowerBI can't be installed on a Mac at the moment, which is limiting to some organizations.  To scale Tableau from a user-specific solution to an organization is not only more expensive financially, it's also expensive in resources and operations as well. I feel like scaling PowerBI is much simpler, but YMMV.",1
"I'd like to add that Sedgwick was actually my university professor, and even with the author of the book available as a resource to me I was often confused. Sedgwick is REALLY into algorithms, from an academic standpoint, so the 'why' for him is very different from somebody hoping to reach industry. There are three aspects to a given problem I want to mention: 1. the motivation for theory the problem. Since you're in puter science and not pure mathematics, you probably know on a high level why graph theory might be useful. But what about strongly connected ponents? Can you think of a toy problem in which strongly connected ponents would be useful? 2. the algorithm itself. This is the 'how', of course the goal of an algorithm is to solve the problem AND do so efficiently within spac time bounds. 3. The proof. This is the where you have to understand WHY it works. As far as pre-order, post-order and reverse post-order, these are just specific orderings of vertices. They are used within the algorithm to achieve the best possible worst-case bounds for the algorithm. Graph theory is really cool, understanding algorithms takes time and is very unintuitive at first, don't give up if you see something worth it on the other side",0

"I'm obviously biased for small panies. I started one and I helped two go from small to big. Working at a small pany makes you feel more connected to the product it is building and the decisions that shape it. I think mentorship is generally worse, but not always. You'll have to teach yourself to fish a lot more often.  Just ask how much cash the pany has and how long it will last before they have to raise again. This likely won't be longer than 2 years except in crazy winning scenarios. Likely if your time horizon is 3-4 years, the pany will go to the capital markets to raise money in your tenure. If things are going poorly for the pany there will be no raise and the pany will go out of business. This is just the risk of going to panies that aren't profitable which is most startups. You have to be fortable with that risk. I don't sponsor immigrants at my startup. I am an immigrant and got my green card after 9 years at my first pany. I have nothing against immigrants. I am one. Dealing with immigration lawyers and immigrant employees adds a lot of plexity. I can only handle so much plexity. Immigrants are really passionate and nervous about immigration and rightfully so. So, it's a hard problem I don't understand where the consequences of failure are high that is only marginally important to my business I can hire non-immigrants pretty easily .

"If this isn't what you need, then just skip it. I'm sick with a cold and can't sleep, so of course my fevered brain has latched on to your ment. It's a distraction. The selection of a pivot doesn't really matter for the purpose of understanding how quicksort works. You could always pick the first item, or the last item, or the middle item, or have some fancier way of picking the middle value choosing between the first, middle, and last item or just pick one at random. Doesn't matter for understanding the algorithm more on pivots below, though . This is the part you probably already know, but just in case: The key thing to understand about quicksort is that once you've chosen a pivot and have moved the smaller stuff to the left and larger stuff to the right the pivot is where it should be. In the final sorted list that's exactly where that value should go. Since it's larger than all the items on the left it can't go farther left unless there are some items that should be to the right of the pivot. We've already said that all the items on the left are smaller, so that can't be true. By the same reasoning it can't go farther right. Again, stuff you probably already know, but I'm sick, so cut me some slack: Since the pivot however you chose it is now in the right spot and all the stuff on the left should stay on the left and all the stuff on the right should stay on the right, if you were to sort the stuff on the left and then sort the stuff on the right, then you're done. The whole list would be sorted. Luckily, you already have a way to sort the left and right parts--your quicksort algorithm. You just apply the exact same algorithm to just the stuff on the left excluding the pivot and then to just the stuff on the right excluding the pivot . As part of applying the algorithm, you also apply the algorithm each side's sub-parts. You split the left part into a left and right, and reapply it to those parts, and same for the right. Just keep doing that as you split each piece into smaller and smaller pieces. After each time through, you've put at least one more item in the spot it should go. Once you get down to single items, you're done. A list with one item or none is, of course, already sorted. As for pivot selection, the main thing you're trying to do is pick an item that ends up in the middle of all the values. We could talk about why that's better, if you want, but just take for granted that it is for now. With that as a goal you could probably think of all kinds of ways to try to choose a pivot that will end up in the middle. The problem is, that without looking at all the items you can't be sure you've got the middle one. If you did look at all the items, though, then the algorithm wouldn't be as efficient, so sometimes people try to use a technique that will probably give a good pivot at least most of the time, but it is cheap. Always picking the first item or always picking last item is how quicksort is taught at first, usually. That's fine, but it isn't great if the list is already sorted or reverse sorted because you'll always pick an item that ends up at one end or the other and never in the middle which making the running time O n^2 and not O n log n . So people will sometimes pick a random pivot, or the middle item, or look at the first, last, and middle and pick the one in the middle of those three. You get the idea. Something cheap that's likely to pick an item that will probably on average end up in the middle. The main point is that no matter what you do unless you look at all the items pivot selection is a crap shoot. You're just trying to do something cheap that gives a good probability of picking a good pivot most of the time. So if you're confused about why the implementation in the book did what it did, that part might not have been clear. If that wasn't clear in your reading of it then of course that would be super confusing, because there isn't really a ""best"" way to pick a pivot that's both cheap and guaranteed to be the middle item each time. You're just playing the odds and trying to make them the most in your favor as you can without costing too much. I'd for sure bet $1 on a 50-50 chance to win $1000, but I wouldn't bet $1000 on a 50-50 chance to win $1. Pivot selection is just trying to stack the odds in your favor.",0

"Kind of annoying that there isn't much standardization in online masters programs. Generally you have two tiers of programs, and they are priced appropriately.  What places like GA Tec Uof UM OSU are offering are a near pletely asynchronous experience. Yes it aligns with a semester, and you have a professor who hosts office hours, but all the classes are normally watch on your own tim pre-recorded - and group work is not usually prioritized.  What the 'expensive' places are offering JH, BU, SMU, RIT are offering is akin to in-person degree program, and many even offer a oncampu virtual mix program. These programs are both asynchronous and synchronous - you're in a virtual classroom with a class of ~20 people, a professor, discussion and lecture slides, in addition to those asynch videos.  Normally you're probably looking at ~$600 per credit hr for the asynch type degree programs, and ~$1500 for async synch type programs.  I would argue that the synchronous programs offer a much more immersive experience and are much more time consuming than the asynchronous. The question really b es, at the end of the day, if these programs all look generally the same on paper which for the most part they do , is the 3x cost worth it for the more immersive program.  For full disclosure, my MS was 'expensive', but despite being mostly online, the experience was inline with what I got from my in-person undergraduate degree. Fortunately very little out of pocket expense thanks to tuition reimbursement. If I could do it over again - I'm not sure if I would go the cheaper route.

"Managin Hiring DS here: A few ways to go about this.  If you're using a personal project to sort of make up for lack of job experience new grads, career change, etc.. , I wouldn't hesitate to call it out in a 'Projects' section of your resume. Include your github on your resume so I can can check out your project, but also see caveat below.  If you have experience in industry already, I would say dont explicitly include it...UNLESS its a really involved, unique and impressive. If its just run of the mill, just link to your git, a good hiring manager will look through it. Put some thought into your git landing to direct people where you want them first.  Caveat: Honestly though, worst thing you can do is include a project section and have things like the kaggle housing data set, NYPD arrest data, etc.. the 'Machine Learning 101' type datasets. For me it shows that you're not innovative and that you just feel fortable regurgitating problems that have been beat to death...I dont care how clean the code is or how pretty the corr plot is.  Personally when I do a phone screen of someone, I'll touch ask them to talk me through their resume on the front end. On the back end, before questions, I basically ask if there is anything they would like to talk about that I didnt question them on. Obviously not everyone interviews this way...but if you really think your projects are going to add to your case, at the end, during question thank yous...or even in your followup email not emai letter, don't hesitate to just say something akin to 'check my github, ive got some cool projects in there'.

"My pany is in the midst of a digital transformation - much like yours - also a legacy pany with a heavy engineering focus much like yours . IMO the reason Azure is gaining ground is because of panies like ours ol slower adopter risk adverse who are starting to make this cloud migration en mass. Microsoft has dominated many of these panies for decades, and that translates to Azure with mon design languages, nomenclature, integration with office suite, etc...  When Azure was settled on, I was less than thrilled, mainly because I came from places using AWS, and was familiar with it from personal experience.  That said - Azure has won me over, they've really put some thought into key piece of their platform. Obviously I cant speak from a I Sys admin side of things although I work with them closely and they seem to be happy , but as a DS team that has to create data piplines its really streamline - IoT hub, Data Factory, even deployment with PowerBI integration are great.  Obviously your traditional stores blo lak sq etc.. are pretty standard in capability across all platforms, but Azure has been turning an eye towards analytical stores and workflows - especially with the recent release of Synapse, which is beyond anything that AW G has imo. But also with stream analytics, and event hubs, etc.. Really well thought out. Finally - as for more traditional ML platforms, we're mostly on Azure Databricks really strong partnership there , but Azure Notebooks are good as well. NOTE: I think as of about a month ago, ML Studio has been deprecated and everything is just rolls up under the 'Azure Machine Learning' umbrella - I think providers are realizing there is minimal value in 'self serve' ML.  There are some problems though - the names and groupings of tools are in flux see my note about M ML studi Azure notebooks as they are still sort of feeling out what resonates best with corporations. It makes it hard to keep track of things. Also the training is not nearly as prehensive as AWS which tries to entice smaller adopters - read: less $ , and as such Azure relies a lot more heavily on enterprise type training $$$$ .  At the end of the day M Googl Amazon are all going to give you the same general experience, they each try and focus on slightly different slices of the market as their core business, and as such will develop and tailor to them.

"Ok. In another ment you mention that such a meta spec needs to have much putational power. This seems to rule out any “automatic creation”, right? Anyways, it reminds me of models and “meta models”.

"Ok. That can be done without mentioning regular languages. I can show that if L is recognized by a finite automaton then pref L can also be recognized by a finite automaton hence it is also regular , but that automaton may not be the same one as L.

Just say that all q in M is an accepting state in ~M if there’s a path from q to an accepting state in M. If f q,y =f in M then q is accepting state in ~M because f s,xy =f in M. I hope that makes sense. I can dm you the proof I was paraphrasing but it mentions regular languages and I tried to avoid that. Also sorry about formatting but I’m on mobile.",0

To solve this issue, we just need to mark q₃ as non-accepting. Done. --- The key-insight in this exercise is: Every x ∈ Pref L ""lies on the path"" from q₀ to some final state, so we mark all the potential states in-between as final.",0

"Others have provided generic encouragement, so I will focus on just your single example. A reverse HTTP proxy sits ”in front” of a webserver between the clien browser and the webserver . So when the client requests data from the webserver could be a static file, but probably an API call in your case , the request hits the proxy. Some reverse proxies ""often"" serve a response from their cache, either to take the load off of the real webserver, or because the reverse proxy sits geographically close to the client, so the network bandwidth an or total latency is much less see ""Content Delivery Network"" a la Akamai or Amazon CloudFront . When you watch a video on Netflix, you are probably not streaming that video from their central datacenter, but from a reverse proxy CDN edge node in your city unless it is a very unpopular video and you are the first person in your city to watch that video in the last 48 hours, so it was not worth keeping a cached copy on the edge node hard disk .  Ingress nodes are similar, but different. They do not exist to provide caching, but to bridge two networks that are either not patible or should be kept separate for reasons such as security. In the security case, let's say your application server is very plex itself which means bugs and security vulnerabilities are more likely , and it needs to talk to a database, NFS server, etc. You would not want to expose it to the Internet. So you firewall all of those machines away from the Internet, and stand up a reverse proxy that is as simple as possible, well tested, on a hardened machine, etc., and expose that machine to the Internet, and allow only that machine to e through the firewall ports 80 and 443 to hit your vulnerable application server. The reverse proxy would be said to reside in your DMZ, and the rest of the machines needed to fulfill the transaction would be ""internal"". For the other case i patible networks , Kubernetes aka k8s is an example. For k8s, redundant, cluster-aware service discovery is through a special borked DNS that is shared among cluster nodes. If an external client wants to talk to services on cluster nodes, they would have to be reconfigured to use the special cluster DNS servers for their DNS resolution. DNS is already a shitshow, without deliberately breaking it. So instead, you take cluster nodes that already have that DNS configuration and run reverse proxy instances usually NGinx so that when someone requests a resource via HTTP S , the proxy requests the response from the k8s service s , and returns that response back to the n blissfully-non-cluster-aware client.",0

"Perhaps why coding it over instead of copying it over works is that you see the build up or something. A lot of things involve lots of variables too and while coding it out you start recognizing the variables more than when you just read it and constantly have to look back ""wait it's doing what to what now?"".  At least that's the way I feel when reading algorithm implementation code sometimes, it's like the instance variables are accessed during the steps but I often don't have familiarity with what each thing is and how it is changed during the steps. Writing out the code perhaps gives you better insight or familaritiy with what you're looking at? I feel testing an algorithm and tracking what happens with breakpoints also kind of helps in a way, but I don't think it has helped me much with the intuition of why an algorithm does something when the reason why it does something is something plex or induced by logic. For example I can follow a sorting algorithm usually by tracing the stack, but for some things that requires deeper understanding for individual steps it takes it's more difficult. I guess a sorting algorithm is a very visual thing and you mostly always know what it is trying to achieve, so that kind of makes it easier to see how it does it.",0

"Say you got an automata A. So for any *xy* in *L* where *x ∈ {a,b}\** and *y ∈ {a,b}\** there must be a path from q₀ to a final state.

Almost all you need to do is to modify A such that all states are accepting and you're done, since all of these states will be visited by some *x*. If you do that you will, however, potentially introduce accepted words that are not in Pref L . This will happen if there are states where there is no outgoing transition that leads to an accepting state. Eg. for the automata:   q₀ -a-&gt; q₁ -a-&gt; q₂    \    b-&gt; q₃ The state q₃ cannot lead to an accepted word. I'll let you figure out what to do for such automata, should be easy enough.",0

And for many difficult tasks in ones career, realizing the right question can be just as important as finding the right answer. By 'educated' I mean that you don't necessarily remember the small details about the classes you studied, but university and college forms your overall values and gives you a nuanced perspective on things. Things you might not really think about on a daily basis, like what Epistemological attitudes and values you have, and how you approach problem solving. I'd say a big chunk of fresh graduates are both mediocre at programming and in solving practical technical problems when they land their first job, and that's usually true for at least a couple of months or more. But you know, that's okay and entirely natural. No one can dive into a new job with no experience and be proficient from the get go. Use the skills I mentioned and effectively learn the things you need. Fill those gaps which everyone starts out with . Do whatever works. Googl Duckduck go, StackOverflow, a subscription to ACM and other journals, arxiv, or asking a colleague.",0

"Thank you, I watched the video and I think I will try to read chapters this way from now on. &gt;You read the chapter before the exercises. Which means your brain didn't have a problem to pick away at while reading. Just re-reading parts is bound to fail because you're still lacking an overarching structure to fit things into. The thing is, oftentimes with cs stuff I kind of understand what it is trying to explain and what the overlying purpose is of what I'm learning, but the explanation itself is so plicated that I can't seem to process it. I had a lot of trouble understanding quicksort for example, and I still don't entirely understand it. However one thing I did notice is that for example I did not really know what a pivot is while trying to understand quicksort, and I still don't. So I think it can be attributed to:  &gt; You might be missing necessary background though any textbook worth its salt will at least hint at the background required  Because most of the time when I can't even process something at all, it's because the smaller bits in the explanation don't really make sense to me. For example in the Kosajaru-Sharir algorithm it involves getting the reverse postorder in the first step, but after an explanation of the reverse postorder before it I didn't really understand what the reverse postorder was for. So then it makes sense that I can't understand this algorithm, because a part of it is also a mystery to me. I feel like maybe parts of my lack of prehension are caused by either: going too fast through new material that builds upon itself very quickly, meaning that I start missing prerequisite information that I need, or there is some sort of knowledge required that I didn't know about at all and that wasn't taught recently. For example some kind of mathematical concept or something from ages ago that I just never fully understood either and now need.",0

"That theorem applies only to the paramete return mappings of a function, but I'm including also introspection ability. For example, given a lambda function that infinite loops for every possible parameter, a function which takes it as a parameter can emulate it 1 pute step at a time by getting its childs recursively without ever calling it, pared to normal lambdas which must call their parameter to measure anything about them. Since theres the introspection ability, equality is not just by the paramete return mapping but is by the forest shape itself. Given any lambda function x, it can give you back a lambda call which returns that, its forest childs.",0
"That's a good idea. It certainly seemed like the best idea when I first started developing him. I walked back the decision to the current implementation for a few reasons - all of which are non-issues today. 1. **I wasn't sure it would solve the problem.** I assumed that all user behaviors would be lagged if datascience-bot experiences high latency with Reddit's servers. That's clearly not the case because datasience-bot's ments were getting posted even though the removal wasn't actioned yet. 1. **I didn't want to go above AWS free-tier.** Checking past ment history extends the runtime of datascience-bot's moderate-submissions program. datascience-bot as single lambda function, and it wasn't clear to me if my personal AWS account was going to stay in free-tier range. Again, this is a non-issue because datascience-bot hardly consumes any resources as it is. 1. **It's easier to just remove posts.** Less can go wrong with `submission.mod.remove ` than a function that parses over previous ments and checks for duplicate behavior. The refactor should address this by making datascience-bot far more modular. I've been meaning to get these thoughts out of my head and onto the page. I'm glad you prompted me.",1

"That’s a typical setting in many systems. I deal with highly reliable engineering systems with very rare anomalies. My approach is the following : 1 build a model of normal behavior. I tend to use Probabilistic models but feel free to use anything you like. This model of normal should be flexible enough to capture the plexity of your data. 2 define a scoring function. Preferably a calibrated one. I use two types of scoring functions. One scoring function for each observation. This can be enough for many settings if each observation is iid and there is not time dependency. However if your data contained multiple observations per entity, then you need a second scoring function, an entity scoring function. I typically use the CDF of the model as my scoring function for each observation or sometimes the cdf -log pdf x  if you want symmetrical scoring function i.e. high score for extreme values on both ends of the distribution . As for the entity scoring function, I typically sum the observation level scores and use the cdf of the irwin hall distribution to score the sum. Happy to chat more if interested...",1

"The block chain itself is fairly simple. To make changes extremely difficult, the blocks of data that are to be stored are linked together. How this works is that when a new block is added, it is ""sealed"" with a cryptographic hash over the contents of the block AND the hash of the previous block. The purpose of this is that every block's signature the hash depends on every prior block. That makes it impossible to change history without resigning every block after it. That's the basic blockchain concept. The only other thing to figure out is who can sign the blocks. Crypto currencies use a proof of work mechanism to avoid central control. A mercial blockchain could just assign a group of trusted entities, avoiding the whole mining cost. The last detail is that the majority of miner trusted entities have to agree to accept a new block. That majority vote prevents malicious actors adding to the chain. So now you have a record of *things* that the majority agrees on and can't be altered without the cooperation of a majority.",0

The two are not unrelated but in this context I believe the student is defeating himself before trying!  More so it seems like trying here means beating ones head against the wall.

The higher the CPU's clock speed what you call frequency , the faster it can handle instructions. The more switches a CPU has, the more instructions it can handle at the same time.  Computing speed has other limiting factors, like amount of memory and speed of memory storage.  CPU manufacturers publish the instruction sets to their CPUs.

"Well, you never specified that you were paring a degree in Statistics to degrees in puter science, physics, so no - I did not mean to imply that a degree in Stats is somehow pareto superior to those other degrees. Having said that, puter science, physics and engineering are not fields where analyst is a traditional role. To major in those fields with a goal to b e an analyst is rare - with the exception being industrial engineering. And that is because these fields spend paratively little time focusing on developing and understanding of how businesses operate. Finance and economics are majors that traditionally go into analyst roles, but they are going to be more industry-restricted than a statistics major. A stats major should be able to operate in most environments, whereas finance and economics may get pigeonholed into the industries that traditionally employ them. The other consideration is that all of these degrees have a different mat stats foundation, therefore your transition into more technical positions like data scientist may be more difficult for some of them.",1

"When I was in grad school one of the guys in our lab did research on using an agent-based modeling platform to ‘grow’ cities from simple organizational diagrams.

"While I'm not approaching this from a puter science perspective, rather EE in manufacturing, here's my take: You can define your project around the use of any of the aforementioned, but what you really should do is define the true intent of what you need. I can say ""For this project, use 100 Amp variable speed drive"". While yes, we can use that, it doesn't really define the parameters of use. ""We need a device with viarable PWM output, that has a carrier frequency of 2kHz to help reduce noise, but can also operate at 50C ambient temperature without having to derate capabilities, and can drive a 75HP motor at 460V up to 80Hz"" What I'm trying to get at is that a lot of people have a hard time specifying what is truly necessary - or the terms in which they typically pick certain ponents or methods of doing things. ""I want bluetooth for this device."" ""Well, how far do away do you need to municate from?"" ""300ft"" ""Well, that won't work, as bluetooth fails at that distance."" While it might be nice, focusing on what the true requirements are can help you understand what the next level of specifications you need to address will be.",0

"Ya, similar story. 1st puter experience was with BASIC on an apple II plus in 5th or 6th grade. I was lucky that I was in a private elementary school. Then I began writing lewd programs in basic around the age of 13 on a friend's tsr-80.  I only took 100 level cs courses in college. Never owned a puter myself until I bought an old IBM 8088 in 94 from an auction house for $60. But that somehow turned into 20 years as a software engineer before I burned out.

"Yeah I got the principle of cutting the list and the general thing of arranging things in such a way that left is less and right is more and then bining them, what was more confusing to me though was the pivot choosing method itself in the implementation and how it recursively does everything for sorting the whole list. I understand recursion pretty well otherwise and recursion isn't too hard to follow if I draw it out because it's simply iterating an operation until you reach some kind of endpoint for the recursion, but if I don't understand what is happening in the recursive steps I get thrown off really hard.",0
"Yeah I only half understood what and didn't understand the why at all. Especially when they suddenly started talking about the pre, post and reverse post order I kind of understood *how* these were built DFS and saving the vertexes you e across along the way and then on the return calls after recursion is done, one of which of these you save as a different datastructure so that it's reversed but I didn't really understand why it was telling me how to build these orders and then when Kosajaru-Sharir came along it literally just looked like a bunch of random steps that somehow identified the strongly connected ponents.",0
Yeah I was really surprised by the real world applications of these algorithms.,0
"Yeah it does seem like it's a lot of gotcha moments.. I remember when I started learning I didn't even understand functions very well when they were introduced. Then I literally typed over the code from the book lol, it was physical instead of an ebook so I couldn't just ctrl-c it and while coding it out it suddenly start making sense to me even though it was the exact same thing from the book. Somehow just looking at it from a different angle made it make some sense.

Just think if you didn’t have the degree you wouldn’t have known how to ask the right question as the saying goes “you don’t know what you don’t know”. So don’t fear everyone went through the same process and as any expert will tell you, the more knowledgeable you b e the more you realize how little you actually know.",0

"You can't fix y and then say thus Pref L is such and such.

There is still an automata for Pref L = a* | a*b by Kleenes theorem. --- 1: Expanding {a,b}* into {ε} ∪ {a,b}+ 2: Definition of L and L ⊆ {a,b}* 3: For xy ∈ L we must have y ending in b, and it can't contain another b 4: Similarly x can't contain any b symbols.",0

Try some problems, try to figure out what I don't know. By that I mean I just need to know the thing I don't get.   Go to lass, listen to lecture, be prepared to ask a clarifying question if your pro lecturer is good with that.   Try to work through the assigned problems   GO TO OFFICE HOURS. My professors would carry students across the finish line if they read the material, tried the problems and were prepared to demonstrate what they could and couldn't do in office hours. On the other hand, if they weren't putting in the effort there was little they could do for them.   With that all said, I had math classes that I was lost on day 1. Differential geometry hit me out of left field, but it turns out that what I was missing was pretty quick and easy to explain, a little exterior algebra here, a few examples and I was golden.",0

"You're always going to be learning if you're involved with tech. I assume you're a relatively junior develope engineer of some sort, and that's totally fine. It can be overwhelming at times, and frankly it might sometimes take effort to catch up or keep up with the industry --especially if you're playing with the newest and loudest abbreviation flavors of the moment.  Youtube is overflowing with tutorials, but I tend to use it mainly as a resource for lectures.  dev.tub  dev.tub  has a great collection.

A lot of interactive hands-on content. Don't feel discouraged when you get stuck. You want to learn about ingress, so you find out it's a reverse proxy, but you don't know what that is. So now you have to look up reverse proxy. You need to follow this process, sometimes going off in a fury of tangential discovery full of missteps and maybe a lot of crap you might not really care about; but, given time, you'll start to see repetition of patterns and concepts, and you'll notice your foundation of knowledge is stabilizing around the needs of your domain. Also note that puter science is a _huge_ field of study, and while there are certainly some intimidating techno-wizards out there who can do it all, many of us often specialize our continuing education and skill sets around the jobs we acquire rather than obtaining a job because we already knew every aspect required to perform any and all immediate and future tasks. And while some will disagree, and this stance isn't always applicable, sometimes it's enough to know _how_ to use a tool without knowing _exactly_ how it's working under the covers.

i'm currently a student in the georgia tech online analytics master's program. feel free to ask questions.,1
"just ask, it wont hurt, and could even show the CEO that you're taking a serious look at the job. &amp;#x200B; now, I'd be more worried about the data situation of a small startup. I've done it before, and if you already know the answers below, then I apologize. The main question I have is ""Do you need a data scientist?"". * Does the pany currently collect data?  * If so, how is the data collected? Is this the correct collection? Do you have Subject Matter Experts to confirm? * How is data stored, accessed, updated, etc.? Is there a database administrator, data engineer, or big data expert?  * I've heard that for every data scientist there should be at least 1 if not 2 data engineers. * For the insight analytic ML that CEO is planning to use, do you think they have the right amount of data and a high enough fidelity to achieve results? The reason I say this is because there are so many ""business savvy"" folks especially in the start up world that latch onto data science and think they will have the next million dollar Machine Learning masterpiece. And so, they hire a data scientist or a few , with a piss-poor data foundation collection, storage, engineering, ETL . The team of data scientists ultimately b e data engineers for the pany, maybe makes a few dashboards, or spends all their time trying to find ways to *collect* better quality data. The CEO sees that they have no fancy AI algorithm to brag about, and thinks you're all bad data scientists.",1

" Throwaway34532345433 pointed out that Reddit's servers were wonky at the time. When Reddit’s servers lag, datascience-bot can't verify that it has acted on a submission. I’m refactoring datascience-bot to address these problems now, but the fixes are a few weeks away yet.  For more detail, the only way around this problem is to give datascience-bot some memory of it's past behavior. Today, that means he ignores removed submissions. I could stand up a DynamoDB backend to track him, or I could just use Reddit's systems as the database. I opted for the latter when creating him.  Since Reddit was down, datascience-bot's ""database"" was down, and so he had no short-term memory.  The refactor will give datascience-bot more prehensive memory, but I doubt I'll stand up a DynamoDB backend for this specific use case. Doing so just moves the problem into my wallet and into services I have to monitor and manage. Today Reddit does it for free and has a dedicated ops team to fix these issues.",1
