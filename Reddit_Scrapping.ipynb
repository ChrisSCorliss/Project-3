Preferably a calibrated one. I use two types of scoring functions. One scoring function for each observation. This can be enough for many settings if each observation is iid and there is not time dependency. However if your data contained multiple observations per entity, then you need a second scoring function, an entity scoring function. I typically use the CDF of the model as my scoring function for each observation or sometimes the cdf(-log(pdf(x))) if you want symmetrical scoring function (i.e. high score for extreme values on both ends of the distribution). As for the entity scoring function, I typically sum the observation level scores and use the cdf of the irwin hall distribution to score the sum.

Microsoft has dominated many of these companies for decades, and that translates to Azure with common design languages, nomenclature, integration with office suite, etc... \\\\n\\\\nWhen Azure was settled on, I was less than thrilled, mainly because I came from places using AWS, and was familiar with it from personal experience. \\\\n\\\\nThat said - Azure has won me over, they\\'ve really put some thought into key piece of their platform. Obviously I cant speak from a IT/Sys admin side of things (although I work with them closely and they seem to be happy), but as a DS team that has to create data piplines its really streamline - IoT hub, Data Factory, even deployment with PowerBI integration are great. \\\\n\\\\nObviously your traditional stores blob/lake/sql/etc.. are pretty standard in capability across all platforms, but Azure has been turning an eye towards analytical stores and workflows - especially with the recent release of Synapse, which is beyond anything that AWS/G has imo. But also with stream analytics, and event hubs, etc.. Really well thought out.\\\\n\\\\nFinally - as for more traditional ML platforms, we\\'re mostly on Azure Databricks (really strong partnership there), but Azure Notebooks are good as well. NOTE: I think as of about a month ago, ML Studio has been deprecated and everything is just rolls up under the \\'Azure Machine Learning\\' umbrella - I think providers are realizing there is minimal value in \\'self serve\\' ML. \\\\n\\\\nThere are some problems though - the names and groupings of tools are in flux (see my note about ML/ML studio/Azure notebooks) as they are still sort of feeling out what resonates best with corporations. It makes it hard to keep track of things. Also the training is not nearly as comprehensive as AWS (which tries to entice smaller adopters - read: less $), and as such Azure relies a lot more heavily on enterprise type training ($$$$). \\\\n\\\\nAt the end of the day MS/Google/Amazon are all going to give you the same general experience, they each try and focus on slightly different slices of the market as their core business, and as such will develop and tailor to them. \\\\n\\\\nPersonally I love Azure and will continue to use them for personal projects as well as for work.\",\\n            \"permalink\": \"/r/datascience/comments/ev6jzg/data_science_frameworks_from_main_cloud_providers/ffufu0b/\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \"body\": \"Thank you very much!

I\\'m sick with a cold and can\\'t sleep, so of course my fevered brain has latched on to your comment. It\\'s a distraction.\\\\n\\\\nThe selection of a pivot doesn\\'t really matter for the purpose of understanding how quicksort works. You could always pick the first item, or the last item, or the middle item, or have some fancier way of picking (the middle value choosing between the first, middle, and last item) or just pick one at random. Doesn\\'t matter for understanding the algorithm (more on pivots below, though).\\\\n\\\\nThis is the part you probably already know, but just in case: The key thing to understand about quicksort is that once you\\'ve chosen a pivot and have moved the smaller stuff to the left and larger stuff to the right the pivot is where it should be. In the final sorted list that\\'s exactly where that value should go. Since it\\'s larger than all the items on the left it can\\'t go farther left unless there are some items that should be to the right of the pivot. We\\'ve already said that all the items on the left are smaller, so that can\\'t be true. By the same reasoning it can\\'t go farther right.\\\\n\\\\nAgain, stuff you probably already know, but I\\'m sick, so cut me some slack: Since the pivot (however you chose it) is now in the right spot and all the stuff on the left should stay on the left and all the stuff on the right should stay on the right, if you were to sort the stuff on the left and then sort the stuff on the right, then you\\'re done. The whole list would be sorted. Luckily, you already have a way to sort the left and right parts--your quicksort algorithm. You just apply the exact same algorithm to just the stuff on the left (excluding the pivot) and then to just the stuff on the right (excluding the pivot). As part of applying the algorithm, you also apply the algorithm each side\\'s sub-parts. You split the left part into a left and right, and reapply it to those parts, and same for the right. Just keep doing that as you split each piece into smaller and smaller pieces. After each time through, you\\'ve put at least one more item in the spot it should go. Once you get down to single items, you\\'re done. A list with one item (or none) is, of course, already sorted.\\\\n\\\\nAs for pivot selection, the main thing you\\'re trying to do is pick an item that ends up in the middle of all the values. We could talk about why that\\'s better, if you want, but just take for granted that it is for now. With that as a goal you could probably think of all kinds of ways to try to choose a pivot that will end up in the middle. The problem is, that without looking at all the items you can\\'t be sure you\\'ve got the middle one. If you did look at all the items, though, then the algorithm wouldn\\'t be as efficient, so sometimes people try to use a technique that will probably give a good pivot at least most of the time, but it is cheap. Always picking the first item or always picking last item is how quicksort is taught at first, usually. That\\'s fine, but it isn\\'t great if the list is already sorted (or reverse sorted) because you\\'ll always pick an item that ends up at one end or the other and never in the middle (which making the running time O(n^2) and not O(n log n)). So people will sometimes pick a random pivot, or the middle item, or look at the first, last, and middle and pick the one in the middle of those three. You get the idea. Something cheap that\\'s likely to pick an item that will probably on average end up in the middle.\\\\n\\\\nThe main point is that no matter what you do (unless you look at all the items) pivot selection is a crap shoot. You\\'re just trying to do something cheap that gives a good probability of picking a good pivot most of the time. So if you\\'re confused about why the implementation in the book did what it did, that part might not have been clear.\\\\n\\\\nIf that wasn\\'t clear in your reading of it then of course that would be super confusing, because there isn\\'t really a \\\\\"best\\\\\" way to pick a pivot that\\'s both cheap and guaranteed to be the middle item each time. You\\'re just playing the odds and trying to make them the most in your favor as you can without costing too much. I\\'d for sure bet $1 on a 50-50 chance to win $1000, but I wouldn\\'t bet $1000 on a 50-50 chance to win $1. Pivot selection is just trying to stack the odds in your favor.\",\\n            \"permalink\": \"/r/compsci/comments/eumdvq/how_bad_is_it_that_i_have_zero_clue_how_to_do/ffssmm2/\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \"body\": \"// Thanks anyway\",\\n            \"permalink\": \"/r/compsci/comments/euhxdt/good_book_for_beginner_level_c_programing/ffsrky1/\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \"body\": \"*// Thanks anyway\",\\n            \"permalink\": \"/r/compsci/comments/euhxdt/good_book_for_beginner_level_c_programing/ffsrjge/\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \"body\": \"http://m.nautil.us/blog/why-mathematicians-cant-find-the-hay-in-a-haystack\",\\n            \"permalink\": \"/r/compsci/comments/ev01ij/uncomputable_numbers/ffsrd7r/\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \"body\": \"I very much enjoy the phrase that comes from this fact: \\\\\"Like finding the hay in a haystack\\\\\"\",\\n            \"permalink\": \"/r/compsci/comments/ev01ij/uncomputable_numbers/ffsoss7/\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \"body\": \"Sometimes it helps to watch videos on Udacity or something similar to that to see other instructors cover the same material.

Your company\\'s codebases and your colleagues are great resources for becoming a great developer.\\\\n\\\\nTry to get as far as you can and narrow down what you don\\'t understand into specific questions as opposed to general concepts.

The rest of my coworkers were older than me and had been in the industry for a bit longer. I quickly realized that my breadth of knowledge in the industry was severely lacking. \\\\n\\\\nI found that my years of studying CS topics like: algorithms, operating systems, computer systems, networks, data structures, discrete mathematics, etc really only taught me things at a conceptual level. And honestly looking back at it my CS program was seriously dated. It\\\\u2019s hard to learn new technology from professors that haven\\\\u2019t been in the industry for a few years. So yeah I quickly felt like I didn\\\\u2019t gain anything or much at all from my degree. \\\\n\\\\nFortunately, my company couldn\\\\u2019t have been more supportive and my imposters syndrome forced me to go into fight or flight mode and try to learn as much as I possibly could. \\\\n\\\\nI started in PHP - a very small part of our code base- and was basically writing scripts that performed ETL (extract, transform, load) tasks. Once I gained some confidence, my company tasked me to learn Unity. \\\\n\\\\nI wrote C# scripts to basically run my unity applications. C# is an amazing language to improve your programming skills because it\\\\u2019s strongly typed and you can implement OOP concepts easily. My company assigned me to build an AR app for a Fortune 500 company. That was a wild experience but turned out to be a success. (This has been my most proud accomplished yet)\\\\n\\\\nI then jumped over into our main application and have been learning web development ever since. I\\\\u2019ve taken on more of a backend role. I currently design and develop our APIs. I leverage cloud services (AWS) and architect and develop serverless applications. \\\\n\\\\nIn short, don\\\\u2019t get caught up with not learning anything in school.

A reverse HTTP proxy sits \\\\u201din front\\\\u201d of a webserver (between the client/browser and the webserver). So when the client requests data from the webserver (could be a static file, but probably an API call in your case), the request hits the proxy.\\\\n\\\\nSome reverse proxies \\\\\"often\\\\\" serve a response from their cache, either to take the load off of the real webserver, or because the reverse proxy sits geographically close to the client, so the network bandwidth and/or total latency is much less (see \\\\\"Content Delivery Network\\\\\" a la Akamai or Amazon CloudFront). When you watch a video on Netflix, you are probably not streaming that video from their central datacenter, but from a reverse proxy (CDN edge node) in your city (unless it is a very unpopular video and you are the first person in your city to watch that video in the last 48 hours, so it was not worth keeping a cached copy on the edge node hard disk). \\\\n\\\\nIngress nodes are similar, but different. They do not exist to provide caching, but to bridge two networks that are either not compatible or should be kept separate for reasons such as security. In the security case, let\\'s say your application server is very complex itself (which means bugs and security vulnerabilities are more likely), and it needs to talk to a database, NFS server, etc. You would not want to expose it to the Internet. So you firewall all of those machines away from the Internet, and stand up a reverse proxy that is as simple as possible, well tested, on a hardened machine, etc., and expose that machine to the Internet, and allow only that machine to come through the firewall (ports 80 and 443) to hit your vulnerable application server. The reverse proxy would be said to reside in your DMZ, and the rest of the machines needed to fulfill the transaction would be \\\\\"internal\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nFor the other case (incompatible networks), Kubernetes (aka k8s) is an example. For k8s, redundant, cluster-aware service discovery is through a special (borked) DNS that is shared among cluster nodes. If an external client wants to talk to services on cluster nodes, they would have to be reconfigured to use the special cluster DNS servers for their DNS resolution. DNS is already a shitshow, without deliberately breaking it. So instead, you take cluster nodes that already have that DNS configuration and run reverse proxy instances (usually NGinx) so that when someone requests a resource via HTTP(S), the proxy requests the response from the k8s service(s), and returns that response back to the n blissfully-non-cluster-aware client.\",\\n            \"permalink\": \"/r/compsci/comments/etndot/degree_in_computer_science_and_yet_know_nothing/ffhvfem/\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \"body\": \"Say you got an automata A.
